	Welch Two Sample t-test

data:  Vungle_Spreadsheet[Vungle_Spreadsheet$Strategy == "Vungle A",  and Vungle_Spreadsheet[Vungle_Spreadsheet$Strategy == "Vungle B",     ]$eRPM and     ]$eRPM
t = -1.5064, df = 48.832, p-value = 0.1384
alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0
95 percent confidence interval:
 -0.2611866  0.0373866
sample estimates:
mean of x mean of y

... why are these the same even though in the second one I used paired?
   
   COOPER, DO YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT THIS MEANS? I CAN SEE THAT THE 0 FALLS IN THE 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL, SO DOES THAT MEAN
   THAT THE NULL IS TRUE AND THERE IS NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE MEANS?
